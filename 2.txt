ADDITIONAL RICE FARMING QUERIES & SOLUTIONS
===========================================

1. Q: What is the ideal temperature for rice cultivation?
   A: The ideal temperature for rice growth ranges between 25°C to 35°C. Germination requires 20–35°C, while flowering is best between 25–28°C. Prolonged temperatures above 35°C during flowering can reduce grain yield.

2. Q: What type of soil is best for rice?
   A: Clayey loam to silty loam soils with good water retention and a pH range of 5.5 to 7.0 are ideal for rice cultivation. Acidic soils can be improved by liming.

3. Q: How much water does a rice field need?
   A: Rice requires about 1200–1500 mm of water per growing season. Maintain 5–10 cm of standing water during vegetative growth and drain during maturity for better grain quality.

4. Q: What is System of Rice Intensification (SRI)?
   A: SRI is a method of cultivating rice using less water and young seedlings planted singly at wider spacing. It promotes aerobic soil conditions and significantly increases yield.

5. Q: What fertilizer schedule should I follow for rice?
   A: For medium fertility soil (per acre):
      - Nitrogen (N): 40–60 kg
      - Phosphorus (P2O5): 20–30 kg
      - Potassium (K2O): 20–30 kg
      Apply nitrogen in three splits: 50% basal, 25% at tillering, 25% at panicle initiation.

6. Q: Can organic farming be practiced for rice?
   A: Yes. Use compost, green manure (like Dhaincha), Azolla, biofertilizers (Azospirillum, PSB), and neem-based pest repellents. Avoid synthetic chemicals and follow certification guidelines.

7. Q: How do I prevent lodging in rice?
   A: Avoid excess nitrogen, use shorter duration or dwarf varieties (e.g., IR64), transplant young seedlings (15–18 days old), and maintain appropriate plant spacing (20x15 cm).

8. Q: When should I transplant rice seedlings?
   A: Transplant 2–3 seedlings per hill at 2–3 leaf stage (15–18 days old) for short-duration varieties and 20–25 days for medium-duration types.

9. Q: What is the ideal planting season for Kharif rice in India?
   A: Mid-June to mid-July, depending on monsoon arrival. Early planting helps avoid peak pest periods and ensures higher yields.

10. Q: What are the common weather-related stresses for rice?
    A: 
    - Flooding/submergence
    - Drought
    - Heat stress during flowering
    - Cold injury in seedlings (below 15°C)
    Use climate-resilient varieties like Swarna Sub1 (for submergence), Sahbhagi Dhan (for drought).

11. Q: How can I manage weeds in rice fields?
    A: Use pre-emergence herbicides like Butachlor or Pendimethalin within 2 days after transplanting. Hand weeding at 20 and 40 DAT (Days After Transplanting) is effective. For DSR (direct-seeded rice), use post-emergence herbicides like Bispyribac-sodium.

12. Q: What is the role of zinc in rice?
    A: Zinc is vital for tillering and enzyme activity. Deficiency symptoms include bronzing and stunted growth. Apply 25 kg/ha of Zinc Sulphate before transplanting.

13. Q: How do I know my rice crop is ready for harvest?
    A: When 80–85% of the grains on the panicle turn golden yellow and hard. Harvesting at the right time prevents shattering and quality loss.

14. Q: What is Direct Seeded Rice (DSR)?
    A: DSR is sowing seeds directly into the field using a drill machine, eliminating the need for nurseries and transplanting. It saves labor and water but requires precise weed and water management.

15. Q: How to improve soil fertility for rice?
    A: Practice crop rotation (rice-legume), apply compost or FYM (5–10 tons/ha), use green manure, avoid continuous monocropping, and periodically test soil for nutrient corrections.
